## About
I made **kaaninho's mp3** because I wanted a small, simple music player for my desktop. There are no ads or complex menus. It plays music directly from YouTube or your local files with a cool pixel-art style.

If you like retro designs and just want to listen to music while studying or gaming, you will like this!
